Drug interactions (and side effects) can be classified into 2 broad categories.
Let's say that a person is taking Drug A because he has a slow heart rate, and how Drug A works is that it increases the heart rate by binding to receptors in the heart.

When a new drug, Drug B is introduced;
- **Pharmacodynamic interactions** - Drug B alters the dose response relationship of Drug A, or simply put, it alters the magnitude of effect of Drug A on its target(s). Examples include:
  - Drug B competes with and blocks Drug A from binding to the heart receptors. This results in an antagonistic effect whereby the effect of Drug A is decreased. As a result, the person's heart rate drops below normal and results in side effects such as dizziness, due to poorer blood circulation to the brain.
  - Drug B enhances the binding of Drug A to the heart receptors. This results in an additive/synergistic effect, whereby the effect of Drug A is increased. As a result, the person's heart rate increases above normal and results in side effects such as chest pain.
  - Drug B also increases/decreases the heart rate by binding to other receptors. This results in an additive/synergistic/antagonistic effect with Drug A, leading to an increase/decrease in heart rate above/below normal.

- **Pharmacokinetic interactions** - Drug B alters the ADME profile of Drug A, or simply put, it alters the amount of Drug A in the body at a given time.
  - **Absorption:** Drug B increases the absorption of Drug A, resulting in a higher concentration of Drug A in the body at a given time, causing the heart rate to increase above normal.
  - **Distribution:** Drug B causes Drug A to be distributed to the liver instead of the heart, resulting in a lower concentration of Drug A in the heart, at a given time. As a result, the heart rate decreases below normal, and there might even be manifestation of liver side effects.
  - **Metabolism:** during metabolism, Drug A is broken down into inactive metabolites. If Drug B slows down the metabolism of Drug A, this results in a higher concentration of Drug A in the body at a given time, causing the heart rate to increase above normal.
  - **Excretion:** similar concept to metabolism, whereby drugs are excreted and passed out of the body. If Drug B slows down the excretion of Drug A,this results in a higher concentration of Drug A in the body at a given time, causing the heart rate to increase above normal.

- **Common terminology:**
  - **Drug drug interactions:** when two or more drugs react with one another. E.g. Drug A increases the concentration of Drug B (PK), or Drug A increases the potency of Drug B (PD)
  - **Side effects:** Unwanted symptoms caused by medical treatment. E.g. Drug A causes cold sweats, or Drug A + Drug B causes cold sweats
  - **Polypharmacy side effects:** Unwanted symptoms due to a combination of drugs, and cannot be attributed to either individual drug in the pair at the same concentration. E.g. Drug A + Drug B causes cold sweats
  - Metrics used to describe binding affinity (PD):
    - **Kd:** dissociation constant. This describes the drug/receptor interactions at equilibrium. A low Kd value means that a drug has higher affinity for the receptor and fewer molecules of the drug are required to occupy 50 % of the receptor.
    - **IC50:** half maximal inhibitory concentration. This measures the potency of a drug in inhibiting its target. A low IC50 value means that a drug has higher affinity for the target and a lower concentration is needed to inhibit a target by 50%.
    - **Ki:** inhibitory constant. This measures the potency of a drug in inhibiting its target. Very similar concept to IC50, whereby a lower Ki value means that a drug has higher affinity for the target and a lower cncentration is needed to inhibit a target by 50%. Ki can be estimated from IC50.
  - Terms commonly used in PD interactions:
    - **Antagonist/inhibitor/blocker:** blocks the effect of an enzyme/receptor, resulting in a dampened response
    - **Agonist/activator:** binds to/ enhances the effect of an enzyme/receptor, resulting in a response/ elevated response
    - **Modulator:** A looser term that bind to a target and cause a change in the response
  - Terms commonly used in PK interactions:
    - **Pgp:** a transporter protein involved in intestinal absorption, drug metabolism and brain penetration. Drugs that inhibit Pgp can alter the ADME profile of another drug greatly, leading to side effects
    - **Bioavailability:** the percentage of drug that is absorbed into the bloodstream. E.g. if I take 100mg drug, and only 70mg is absorbed into the blood while 30mg is passed out into the feces, then bioavailability is 70%.
    - **Lipophilicity:** measure of the ability of a drug to dissolve in a fatty environment. A drug with high lipophilicity tend to have poorer absorption, more locally distributed into the fat etc.
    - **Solubility:** measure of the ability of a drug to dissolve in an aqueous environment. A drug with high solubility tend to stay within the blood, excreted through the kidneys etc.
    - **Blood brain barrier:** a protective layer surrounding the brain that blocks most drugs from entering. Two drugs that are able to permeate the blood brain barrier can cause an increased risk of neurological side effects.
    - **Plasma protein binding rate:** percentage of drug that is bound to proteins in the blood. Drugs with a higher plasma protein binding rate tend to stay within the blood more
    - **Volume of distribution:** Ratio of a drug's concentration in the body tissues compaared to blood. Drugs with a higher volume of distribution indicates a higher concentration in the body tissues.
    - **CYP P450:** aka cytochrome P450, these are a group of enzymes involved in metabolism (breaking down) the drug.
    - **Half life:** the time taken for the concentration of a drug in the body to be reduced by half. Drugs with a short half life has a shorter duration of action.
    - **Clearance:** the rate at which the drug is removed from the body (e.g. through the kidneys, feces, or sweat). Related to half life.
